 * Auto-renew inside certificates (#289)
 * Notify active users of expiring certificates (#293)
 * Convert service type names to service type codes to support CHAPI
   v2 lookup on services (#290)

== 1.10 ==
 * Reuse existing private keys when renewing certificates (#274)

 * Fix authorization logic for policies with multiple subjects,
   specifically `log_event`: do not overwrite the method variable
   `bindings` with the per-subject bindings. (#287)

== 1.9 ==
 * Store ABAC Guard bindings in a per invocation variable
   to make it threadsafe. (#285)
 * Proper fix to guard on `update_sliver_info`: add logic
   to check arguments that are not subjects (no applicable
   policy). Slivers are the only example of this so far.
   This way, we can get an `ARGUMENT_ERROR` on unknown
   slivers as expected. (#286)

== 1.8 ==

 * Return certificate expiration when requested (#267)
 * When a sliver has no record in the sliver info tables,

   else if you also logging about a slice/project that the other
   person is a member of. (#276)

   for enabling verbose logging in `SubjectInvocationCheck`. (#275,#277)

   extract sliver as a subject. (#283)

   change_membership calls that were missing self argument (#247)
 * Fix stack trace when deauthorizing client tools (#249)
 * Add ability to specify expiration of certificates (#252)
 * geni-sign-tool-csr returns a certificate chain (#256)
 * Project join request IDs should be printed as a string in error
   messages, not an integer. (#257)
 * Populate expiration column on certificate insert (#258)
 * Remove duplicates in list of subjects about whom we do queries,
   unify the queries for permission, and keep only needed bindings, 
   improving performance of permission checking. (#262)

   only log the error once, and avoid re-defining the errorReturn
   method. (#234)

== 1.5 ==
 * Implement Federation API v2 (#204)
 * Fixes to sliver info methods: (#221)
  * Expire sliver info records that claim to have expired
  * Do not list expired slivers

  * Treat email addresses as case insensitive (#203)
  * Handle non string subjects in `flatten_urn` (#206)
  * The author of a log message is taken from the client cert.
    When a user asks to join a project, the author will be the Portal.
    That will now properly display as None. (#205)

    the date comparison to compare within the DB in update_expirations. (#186)
  * Use a string UUID for logging an activated user. (#192)

== 1.0 ==
 * Initial release of new clearinghouse implementing the
 [http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/UniformClearinghouseAPI Uniform
 Federation APIs]. This implementation retains the functionality of
 the previous PHP-based server, but implemented in Python using
 [https://github.com/fp7-ofelia/AMsoil AMsoil]. Note that the `pgch`
 server is now part of this base install, and all services are now
 reached via XML-RPC over SSL.
