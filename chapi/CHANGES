== 1.0 ==
 * Initial release of new clearinghouse implementing the
 [http://groups.geni.net/geni/wiki/UniformClearinghouseAPI Uniform
 Federation APIs]. This implementation retains the functionality of
 the previous PHP-based server, but implemented in Python using

 server is now part of this base install, and all services are now
 reached via XML-RPC over SSL.
